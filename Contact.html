	<h2> The Issues </h2>
	<p>
		Landmines are unaffected by cease-fires or peace. The only way to deactivate them is by individual 
		removal at a cost of US$300â€“1000 per mine. Even with training, mine disposal experts expect that for 
		every 5000 mines cleared one worker will be killed and two workers will be injured by accidental explosions.

	</p>
	<p>
		Mine action is not just about landmines. In many countries, unexploded ordnance, or UXO, poses an even greater 
		threat to people's safety. UXO comprises bombs, mortars, grenades, missiles or other devices that fail to detonate 
		as designed but remain volatile and can kill if touched or moved. Some of the main sources of UXO are cluster bombs. 
		Today, mine-action programmes typically address problems of landmines, UXO and "explosive remnants of war," which 
		includes UXO and "abandoned ordnance," or weapons and remnant Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) left behind by armed 
		forces when they leave an area.<sup><a href="http://www.mineaction.org/issues">[2]</a></sup>
