A) Firebase
1. reports from medical and military HTML pages are NOT being pushed. It seems pushIncidentToDB() isn't being called in their respective JS files.
2. The volunteer report is being pushed, but under strange names (derived from some kind of token?) such as JMnaerhkZfePpSmVJJD. It is possible to have it to to what we want.
Example of what we have: https://shining-fire-2988.firebaseio.com/
Example of what we could have: https://samplechat.firebaseio-demo.com/users/ if we follow this tutorial https://www.firebase.com/docs/ordered-data.html

B) default text changes: 
1. date injured, diagnosed's default are cities.

2. GPS coordinates: add text to tell the user to enter a number outside of the GPS range if they don't know. Default text it to this too.

3. Should we use a different data type than strings for dates? example code: http://www.informationbuilders.com/support/developers/javascript-validate-date-entry

C) naming convention: change typeofreport to type_of_report in js so it is the same style as the other variables
